## Features

| Capability | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication & Roles** | JWT authentication with bcrypt hashing (72-byte limit validation). Three roles: `requester`, `agent`, and `admin`. |
| **Ticket Workflow** | Enforced state transitions (`open` -> `in_progress` <-> `waiting_on_requester`, `in_progress` -> `resolved` -> `closed`, with reopen). Invalid moves return 409. |
| **Business-Hours SLA** | SLA calculated strictly within configurable working hours (`WORK_TIMEZONE`, `WORK_DAY_START`, `WORK_DAY_END`, `WORK_DAYS`) and organization holidays. |
| **Pausable SLA Clock** | Moving to `waiting_on_requester` freezes the SLA clock (`sla_paused_at`); resuming to `in_progress` pushes `due_at` forward by exact elapsed business minutes. |
| **Holidays Management** | Admin CRUD API for organizational holiday calendars (`/api/v1/holidays`), preventing SLA calculations on non-working dates. |
| **AI Triage & Duplicates** | Advisory category/priority suggestions via similarity-weighted kNN voting; duplicate detection over active tickets using L2-normalized cosine embeddings; interactive Streamlit dashboard support with on-demand suggestions, duplicate alerts, and staff-only similar ticket discovery. |
| **Comments & History** | Public comments and staff-only `is_internal` notes. Full status change audit history recorded on state changes. |
| **Search & Pagination** | Sanitized keyword search (`q`), multi-criteria filtering, multi-field sorting, and offset pagination. |
| **SQL Reports** | 9 raw SQL reports using aggregations, `LEFT JOIN`, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and `RANK()` window functions. |
| **Streamlit Dashboard** | Complete management portal covering tickets list, new ticket AI triage, ticket details with audit trail, holiday calendar management, and KPI analytics. |

## Architecture

The system uses a layered architecture separating transport, business logic, persistence, and presentation.

```

---

## Ticket Workflow

The ticket lifecycle follows an explicit state transition machine managed entirely in the service layer.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> open : Ticket Created
    open --> in_progress : Agent Assigned / Work Started
    in_progress --> waiting_on_requester : Pauses SLA Clock (Waiting for Requester)
    waiting_on_requester --> in_progress : Resumes SLA Clock (Pushes due_at by Business Minutes)
    in_progress --> resolved : Resolution Provided
    resolved --> closed : Requester / Admin Closes Ticket
    resolved --> in_progress : Reopened by Staff
    closed --> [*]
```

Any invalid or out-of-order state transition is rejected with an HTTP 409 Conflict status. Tickets in `waiting_on_requester` freeze the SLA clock and are never flagged as overdue while paused.

---

## Database Schema

The database consists of 6 tables managed via Alembic migrations.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    users {
        int id PK
        string email UK
        string full_name
        string hashed_password

        boolean is_active
        datetime created_at
    }

    tickets {
        int id PK
        string title
        text description
        enum status
        enum priority
        enum category

        datetime created_at
    }

    ticket_embeddings {
        int ticket_id PK,FK
        string model_name
        int dim
        blob vector
        datetime updated_at
    }

## AI Triage & Duplicate Detection

Automated category and priority suggestions and duplicate detection over ticket text using L2-normalized cosine embeddings.
Recommendations are strictly advisory and never mutate tickets automatically; agents and users retain full control.
Requesters only see evidence items and duplicate candidates from their own tickets, maintaining strict privacy isolation.
The service exposes `POST /api/v1/triage/suggest` (advisory triage and duplicates) and `GET /api/v1/tickets/{id}/similar` (staff only).
On the benchmark dataset (`data/triage_eval.csv`, synthetic tickets), category accuracy reaches 58.33% vs 16.67% random chance.
Full details: [docs/AI_TRIAGE.md](docs/AI_TRIAGE.md).

## Quick Start

Follow these steps to run the API and Streamlit dashboard locally on Windows PowerShell.

### 1. Clone the repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/pasupunuri-pragnitha/HelpDesk-API.git
cd HelpDesk-API
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -r dashboard/requirements.txt
```

> **Optional**: To enable the optional dense semantic embedding backend (`sbert` / `sentence-transformers`), also install:
>
> ```powershell
> pip install -r requirements-ai.txt
> ```

### 4. Configure environment variables

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Key configuration settings (with default values):

- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for MySQL 8 (`mysql+pymysql://helpdesk:helpdesk_password@localhost:3306/helpdesk_db`)
- `SECRET_KEY`: Secret string for HMAC-SHA256 JWT encoding
- `WORK_TIMEZONE`: Timezone for working hours evaluation (default: `Asia/Kolkata`)
- `WORK_DAY_START`: Working day operational start time (default: `09:00`)
- `WORK_DAY_END`: Working day operational end time (default: `18:00`)
- `WORK_DAYS`: Operational days as JSON list of integers 0=Mon..6=Sun (default: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`)

### 5. Start MySQL database container

```powershell
docker compose up -d db
```

### 6. Run database migrations

```powershell
alembic upgrade head
```

### 7. Create an administrator account or populate demo data

To create an administrator account:

```powershell
python -m app.scripts.create_admin --email admin@example.com --password AdminPassword123! --name "System Admin"
```

Or populate realistic demo data across all workflows, reports, and AI triage embeddings:

```powershell
python -m app.scripts.seed_demo --yes
```

### 8. Run the FastAPI backend

In Terminal 1:

```powershell
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 9. Run the Streamlit dashboard

In a separate PowerShell terminal (Terminal 2):

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

The dashboard will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`. For detailed dashboard documentation, see [dashboard/README.md](dashboard/README.md).

---

## Demo Data

To populate the database with realistic sample tickets across all 6 categories, 4 priorities, workflow statuses (including `waiting_on_requester`), public/internal comments, and overdue SLA scenarios, run the demo seed script:

```powershell
# Using the safety confirmation flag
python -m app.scripts.seed_demo --yes

# Or via environment variable
$env:ALLOW_DEMO_SEED="1"
python -m app.scripts.seed_demo
```

### Demo Accounts

| Role | Email | Password | Full Name |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Admin** | `admin@example.com` | `AdminPassword123!` | System Admin |
| **Agent** | `agent@example.com` | `AgentPassword123!` | Asha Agent |
| **Requester** | `requester@example.com` | `RequesterPassword123!` | Ravi Requester |

> [!WARNING]
> **Local Development Security Warning**: These demo accounts and default passwords in `.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml` are strictly intended for local development, demonstration, and automated test environments. **Never deploy these default passwords in production.**

---

## Testing & Quality

| Metric | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Pytest Tests** | 181 collected (177 passed, 4 skipped without optional dependencies/MySQL URL) |
| **Code Coverage** | 96% statement coverage (`app`) |
| **Database Migrations** | 8 Alembic schema migration versions |
| **User Roles** | 3 (`requester`, `agent`, `admin`) |
| **SQL Reports** | 9 raw SQL analytical reports |

Run the test suite locally with coverage reporting:

```powershell
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=85
```

GitHub Actions CI runs the full test suite with coverage enforcement and executes MySQL 8 migration checks (`upgrade -> downgrade -> upgrade`) on every push and pull request.

---

## Design Decisions

- **404 Instead of 403 for Foreign Tickets**: Requesters attempting to view another user's ticket receive a 404 Not Found rather than 403 Forbidden to prevent ticket ID enumeration.
- **Requester Identity Bound to JWT**: The `requester_id` is always extracted from the authenticated user token, preventing users from creating tickets on behalf of others.
- **Service-Layer State Machine**: Status transitions are defined centrally in `app/services/tickets.py` rather than within routes, guaranteeing uniform business rule enforcement.
- **Business-Hours SLA & Pausable Clock**: SLA deadlines (`due_at`) are calculated strictly during operational business hours, skipping off-hours, weekends, and database-registered holidays. Transitioning a ticket to `waiting_on_requester` pauses the SLA clock by setting `sla_paused_at`, removing it from overdue queries. Returning to `in_progress` computes exact elapsed business minutes and shifts `due_at` forward proportionally.
- **Advisory AI Triage & Privacy**: Category and priority suggestions use similarity-weighted k-Nearest Neighbours over historically resolved tickets. Recommendations never auto-mutate tickets; requesters only see their own tickets in evidence and duplicate candidate lists.
- **Bcrypt 72-Byte Limit Validation**: Pydantic validators explicitly check the UTF-8 byte length (maximum 72 bytes) before passing passwords to bcrypt, avoiding silent password truncation.
- **Dual-Engine Test Strategy**: Local unit tests run against fast in-memory SQLite (`sqlite:///:memory:`) for sub-second execution, while CI executes against MySQL 8 to validate SQL window functions and migrations (which caught a real MySQL-only downgrade bug in migration 0002).
- **Correlation Request-ID Logging**: Middleware extracts or generates an `X-Request-ID` stored in `contextvars`, including it in all log entries across the request lifecycle without logging sensitive tokens or passwords.

---

## Known Limitations

- **Lexical vs. Semantic AI Triage**: The default `hashing-v2` backend uses sublinear-scaled word n-grams (with stop words removed) and character 3-5 n-grams (dim=4096). On our benchmark dataset, category accuracy reaches 58.33% with 100% suggestion coverage (at threshold 0.12). sbert is supported as an optional pluggable embedder (requirements-ai.txt) but has not been measured on this dataset.
- **Offset Pagination**: Pagination uses standard SQL `LIMIT` / `OFFSET`, which is straightforward for moderate datasets but less performant on massive tables than keyset pagination.
- **User Roster Access**: Only admins can list users; agents must input target agent IDs manually when assigning tickets.
- **No Email Notifications**: Ticket lifecycle events and comments are tracked in database history rather than sending outbound email alerts.

---

## Roadmap

- [ ] Keyset/cursor-based pagination for high-volume ticket archives
- [ ] Email notifications via SMTP/SendGrid on status and comment events
- [ ] File and image attachment uploads for tickets and comments
