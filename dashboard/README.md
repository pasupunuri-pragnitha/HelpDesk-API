# HelpDesk Streamlit Dashboard

A modern, interactive management portal and analytics dashboard for the HelpDesk API built with Streamlit.

---

## Features

- **Authentication & Registration**: Clean tabbed login and registration interface storing tokens exclusively in memory (`st.session_state`).
- **Ticket Management**:
  - Filter by Status, Priority, Category (`network`, `hardware`, `software`, `access`, `email`, `other`), keyword search (`q`), and Overdue status.
  - Column headers displaying ID, Title, Category, Status, Priority, Assignee, and Due date.
  - Full server-side pagination ("Page X of Y", "Showing a-b of N tickets") with automatic page-1 reset on filter adjustments.
  - Due dates highlighted in red with overdue indicators.
  - All timestamps automatically converted and formatted in the viewer's local timezone.
  - Requester isolation enforced by backend API.
- **Ticket Detail & Collaboration**:
  - Status, priority, and category badges; SLA due dates; requester and assignee metadata.
  - Category updates for ticket owners (while `open`) and staff (agents/admins anytime).
  - Comment stream with internal notes highlighted and labelled `[Internal]` for staff.
  - Ticket lifecycle status transitions with conflict handling (409 validation).
  - Agent assignment dropdown (with manual agent ID input fallback).
  - Status audit history timeline with local timezone timestamps.
- **Operational Analytics & KPI Reporting** *(Agent and Admin only)*:
  - Real-time KPI metric cards (Open, In Progress, Overdue, SLA Breach Rate %, and Average Resolution Hours).
  - Status distribution bar chart and Tickets by Category bar chart.
  - SLA breach rate by priority bar chart (comparing met vs breached tickets).
  - Average resolution time by category bar chart.
  - Agent rankings with tie handling (`RANK()` window function) and comprehensive Agent Workload table (open work, overdue tickets, and resolved counts).
  - Tickets created per day line chart with adjustable window (7–90 days).
  - Division-by-zero protection and friendly empty-state notifications.

> **Note on Timezones**: All timestamps (ticket creation, SLA due dates, comments, and status audit transitions) are stored and transmitted in UTC by the backend API and converted to the viewer's local machine timezone for display.

## Prerequisites & Installation

Ensure you have a Python 3.11+ environment activated.

Install dashboard dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r dashboard/requirements.txt
```

---

## Configuration

The dashboard communicates with the backend API over HTTP. Configure the API endpoint using the environment variable:

| Environment Variable | Description                       | Default                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `HELPDESK_API_URL`   | Base URL of the Helpdesk REST API | `http://localhost:8000/api/v1` |

---

## Running the Application

### 1. Start the HelpDesk API Backend

From the project root in Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 2. Start the Streamlit Dashboard

In a separate Windows PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

The dashboard will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Demo Accounts Setup

You can test different role-based views (Requester, Agent, Admin) with the following steps:

### 1. Admin Account

Generate an initial administrator account using the management script:

```powershell
python -m app.scripts.create_admin --email admin@example.com --password AdminPassword123! --name "System Admin"
```

### 2. Requester Account

Requesters can self-register directly through the dashboard UI:

1. Open `http://localhost:8501`.
2. Click the **Register** tab.
3. Fill in name, email (e.g. `requester@example.com`), and password (min 8 characters).
4. Click **Create Account** and log in.

### 3. Agent Account

Create an agent account directly via an authenticated admin session or database:

- An Admin can promote or create an agent, or you can register an account and update the `role` column to `'agent'` in the `users` table:

```sql
UPDATE users SET role = 'agent' WHERE email = 'agent@example.com';
```
